# FinPlanIQ

FinPlanIQ is an FP&A and finance analytics portfolio project that simulates a company's monthly financial performance and analyzes budget vs actuals, revenue variance, expense variance, department performance, rolling forecasts, and scenario analysis.

The project is designed for roles such as Financial Analyst, FP&A Analyst, Finance Data Analyst, BI Analyst, Business Analyst in finance, and Risk/Reporting Analyst.

## Business Problem

Finance teams need to understand whether the company is performing above or below plan, which departments are overspending, which revenue segments are underperforming, and how future scenarios may impact profitability.
